group by: groups objects together by a field. so if 2 instances of "john" then will group john together.

order by: orders the objects by a field. 

so if u group 2 eleemnts together it does nothing besides eliminate one of them unless u are using a sum command in which case it will sum 2 fields together.

SQL> SELECT NAME, SUM(SALARY) FROM CUSTOMERS
     GROUP BY NAME;

will sum 2 instances of johns salary

SQL> SELECT NAME FROM CUSTOMERS
     GROUP BY NAME;

will just eliminate the second instance of jon.
